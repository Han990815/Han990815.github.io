# **Logistic Regression Classifier Tutorial with Python**


Hello friends,


In this kernel, I implement Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn. I build a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. I train a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. 

**As always, I hope you find this kernel useful and your <font color="red"><b>UPVOTES</b></font> would be highly appreciated**.

[Table of Contents](#0.1)


When data scientists may come across a new classification problem, the first algorithm that may come across their mind is **Logistic Regression**. It is a supervised learning classification algorithm which is used to predict observations to a discrete set of classes. Practically, it is used to classify observations into different categories. Hence, its output is discrete in nature. **Logistic Regression** is also called **Logit Regression**. It is one of the most simple, straightforward and versatile classification algorithms which is used to solve classification problems.

In statistics, the **Logistic Regression model** is a widely used statistical model which is primarily used for classification purposes. It means that given a set of observations, Logistic Regression algorithm helps us to classify these observations into two or more discrete classes. So, the target variable is discrete in nature.


The Logistic Regression algorithm works as follows -

## **Implement linear equation**


Logistic Regression algorithm works by implementing a linear equation with independent or explanatory variables to predict a response value. For example, we consider the example of number of hours studied and probability of passing the exam. Here, number of hours studied is the explanatory variable and it is denoted by x1. Probability of passing the exam is the response or target variable and it is denoted by z.


If we have one explanatory variable (x1) and one response variable (z), then the linear equation would be given mathematically with the following equation-

    z = β0 + β1x1    

Here, the coefficients β0 and β1 are the parameters of the model.


If there are multiple explanatory variables, then the above equation can be extended to

    z = β0 + β1x1+ β2x2+……..+ βnxn
    
Here, the coefficients β0, β1, β2 and βn are the parameters of the model.

So, the predicted response value is given by the above equations and is denoted by z.

## **Sigmoid Function**

This predicted response value, denoted by z is then converted into a probability value that lie between 0 and 1. We use the sigmoid function in order to map predicted values to probability values. This sigmoid function then maps any real value into a probability value between 0 and 1.

In machine learning, sigmoid function is used to map predictions to probabilities. The sigmoid function has an S shaped curve. It is also called sigmoid curve.

A Sigmoid function is a special case of the Logistic function. It is given by the following mathematical formula.

Graphically, we can represent sigmoid function with the following graph.

### Sigmoid Function

![Sigmoid Function](https://miro.medium.com/max/970/1*Xu7B5y9gp0iL5ooBj7LtWw.png)

## **Decision boundary**

The sigmoid function returns a probability value between 0 and 1. This probability value is then mapped to a discrete class which is either “0” or “1”. In order to map this probability value to a discrete class (pass/fail, yes/no, true/false), we select a threshold value. This threshold value is called Decision boundary. Above this threshold value, we will map the probability values into class 1 and below which we will map values into class 0.

Mathematically, it can be expressed as follows:-

p ≥ 0.5 => class = 1

p < 0.5 => class = 0 

Generally, the decision boundary is set to 0.5. So, if the probability value is 0.8 (> 0.5), we will map this observation to class 1. Similarly, if the probability value is 0.2 (< 0.5), we will map this observation to class 0. This is represented in the graph below-

![Decision boundary in sigmoid function](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/logistic_regression_sigmoid_w_threshold.png)

## **Making predictions**

Now, we know about sigmoid function and decision boundary in logistic regression. We can use our knowledge of sigmoid function and decision boundary to write a prediction function. A prediction function in logistic regression returns the probability of the observation being positive, Yes or True. We call this as class 1 and it is denoted by P(class = 1). If the probability inches closer to one, then we will be more confident about our model that the observation is in class 1, otherwise it is in class 0.


# **3. Assumptions of Logistic Regression** <a class="anchor" id="3"></a>


[Table of Contents](#0.1)


The Logistic Regression model requires several key assumptions. These are as follows:-

1. Logistic Regression model requires the dependent variable to be binary, multinomial or ordinal in nature.

2. It requires the observations to be independent of each other. So, the observations should not come from repeated measurements.

3. Logistic Regression algorithm requires little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables. It means that the independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other.

4. Logistic Regression model assumes linearity of independent variables and log odds.

5. The success of Logistic Regression model depends on the sample sizes. Typically, it requires a large sample size to achieve the high accuracy.

# **4. Types of Logistic Regression** <a class="anchor" id="4"></a>


[Table of Contents](#0.1)


Logistic Regression model can be classified into three groups based on the target variable categories. These three groups are described below:-

### 1. Binary Logistic Regression

In Binary Logistic Regression, the target variable has two possible categories. The common examples of categories are yes or no, good or bad, true or false, spam or no spam and pass or fail.


### 2. Multinomial Logistic Regression

In Multinomial Logistic Regression, the target variable has three or more categories which are not in any particular order. So, there are three or more nominal categories. The examples include the type of categories of fruits - apple, mango, orange and banana.


### 3. Ordinal Logistic Regression

In Ordinal Logistic Regression, the target variable has three or more ordinal categories. So, there is intrinsic order involved with the categories. For example, the student performance can be categorized as poor, average, good and excellent.

### Drop  RISK_MM variable

It is given in the dataset description, that we should drop the `RISK_MM` feature variable from the dataset description. So, we 
should drop it as follows-


```python
df.drop(['RISK_MM'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```


```python

### Types of variables


In this section, I segregate the dataset into categorical and numerical variables. There are a mixture of categorical and numerical variables in the dataset. Categorical variables have data type object. Numerical variables have data type float64.


First of all, I will find categorical variables.


```python
# find categorical variables

categorical = [var for var in df.columns if df[var].dtype=='O']

print('There are {} categorical variables\n'.format(len(categorical)))

print('The categorical variables are :', categorical)
```

    There are 7 categorical variables
    
    The categorical variables are : ['Date', 'Location', 'WindGustDir', 'WindDir9am', 'WindDir3pm', 'RainToday', 'RainTomorrow']
    


```python
# view the categorical variables

df[categorical].head()
```

### Summary of categorical variables


- There is a date variable. It is denoted by `Date` column.


- There are 6 categorical variables. These are given by `Location`, `WindGustDir`, `WindDir9am`, `WindDir3pm`, `RainToday` and  `RainTomorrow`.


- There are two binary categorical variables - `RainToday` and  `RainTomorrow`.


- `RainTomorrow` is the target variable.

## Explore problems within categorical variables


First, I will explore the categorical variables.


### Missing values in categorical variables


```python
# check missing values in categorical variables

df[categorical].isnull().sum()
```




    Date                0
    Location            0
    WindGustDir      9330
    WindDir9am      10013
    WindDir3pm       3778
    RainToday        1406
    RainTomorrow        0
    dtype: int64




```python
# print categorical variables containing missing values

cat1 = [var for var in categorical if df[var].isnull().sum()!=0]

print(df[cat1].isnull().sum())
```

    WindGustDir     9330
    WindDir9am     10013
    WindDir3pm      3778
    RainToday       1406
    dtype: int64
    

We can see that there are only 4 categorical variables in the dataset which contains missing values. These are `WindGustDir`, `WindDir9am`, `WindDir3pm` and `RainToday`.

### Frequency counts of categorical variables


Now, I will check the frequency counts of categorical variables.


```python
# view frequency of categorical variables

for var in categorical: 
    
    print(df[var].value_counts())
```

### Number of labels: cardinality


The number of labels within a categorical variable is known as **cardinality**. A high number of labels within a variable is known as **high cardinality**. High cardinality may pose some serious problems in the machine learning model. So, I will check for high cardinality.


```python
# check for cardinality in categorical variables

for var in categorical:
    
    print(var, ' contains ', len(df[var].unique()), ' labels')
```

    Date  contains  3436  labels
    Location  contains  49  labels
    WindGustDir  contains  17  labels
    WindDir9am  contains  17  labels
    WindDir3pm  contains  17  labels
    RainToday  contains  3  labels
    RainTomorrow  contains  2  labels
    

We can see that there is a `Date` variable which needs to be preprocessed. I will do preprocessing in the following section.


All the other variables contain relatively smaller number of variables.

### Feature Engineering of Date Variable


```python
df['Date'].dtypes
```




    dtype('O')



We can see that the data type of `Date` variable is object. I will parse the date currently coded as object into datetime format.


```python
# parse the dates, currently coded as strings, into datetime format

df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
```


```python
# extract year from date

df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year

df['Year'].head()
```




    0    2008
    1    2008
    2    2008
    3    2008
    4    2008
    Name: Year, dtype: int64




```python
# extract month from date

df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month

df['Month'].head()
```




    0    12
    1    12
    2    12
    3    12
    4    12
    Name: Month, dtype: int64




```python
# extract day from date

df['Day'] = df['Date'].dt.day

df['Day'].head()
```




    0    1
    1    2
    2    3
    3    4
    4    5
    Name: Day, dtype: int64




```python
# again view the summary of dataset

df.info()
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 142193 entries, 0 to 142192
    Data columns (total 26 columns):

    dtypes: datetime64[ns](1), float64(16), int64(3), object(6)
    memory usage: 28.2+ MB
    

We can see that there are three additional columns created from `Date` variable. Now, I will drop the original `Date` variable from the dataset.


```python
# drop the original Date variable

df.drop('Date', axis=1, inplace = True)
```


```python
# preview the dataset again

df.head()
```

<p>5 rows × 25 columns</p>

Now, we can see that the `Date` variable has been removed from the dataset.


### Explore Categorical Variables


Now, I will explore the categorical variables one by one. 


```python
# find categorical variables

categorical = [var for var in df.columns if df[var].dtype=='O']

print('There are {} categorical variables\n'.format(len(categorical)))

print('The categorical variables are :', categorical)
```

    There are 6 categorical variables
    
    The categorical variables are : ['Location', 'WindGustDir', 'WindDir9am', 'WindDir3pm', 'RainToday', 'RainTomorrow']
    

We can see that there are 6 categorical variables in the dataset. The `Date` variable has been removed. First, I will check missing values in categorical variables.


```python
# check for missing values in categorical variables 

df[categorical].isnull().sum()
```




    Location            0
    WindGustDir      9330
    WindDir9am      10013
    WindDir3pm       3778
    RainToday        1406
    RainTomorrow        0
    dtype: int64



We can see that `WindGustDir`, `WindDir9am`, `WindDir3pm`, `RainToday` variables contain missing values. I will explore these variables one by one.

### Explore `Location` variable


```python
# print number of labels in Location variable

print('Location contains', len(df.Location.unique()), 'labels')
```

    Location contains 49 labels
    


```python
# check labels in location variable

df.Location.unique()
```

# check missing values in numerical variables

df[numerical].isnull().sum()
```




    MinTemp            637
    MaxTemp            322
    Rainfall          1406
    Evaporation      60843
    Sunshine         67816
    WindGustSpeed     9270
    WindSpeed9am      1348
    WindSpeed3pm      2630
    Humidity9am       1774
    Humidity3pm       3610
    Pressure9am      14014
    Pressure3pm      13981
    Cloud9am         53657
    Cloud3pm         57094
    Temp9am            904

On closer inspection, we can see that the `Rainfall`, `Evaporation`, `WindSpeed9am` and `WindSpeed3pm` columns may contain outliers.


I will draw boxplots to visualise outliers in the above variables. 


```python
# draw boxplots to visualize outliers

plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))


plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
fig = df.boxplot(column='Rainfall')
fig.set_title('')
fig.set_ylabel('Rainfall')


plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
fig = df.boxplot(column='Evaporation')
fig.set_title('')
fig.set_ylabel('Evaporation')


plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
fig = df.boxplot(column='WindSpeed9am')
fig.set_title('')
fig.set_ylabel('WindSpeed9am')


plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
fig = df.boxplot(column='WindSpeed3pm')
fig.set_title('')
fig.set_ylabel('WindSpeed3pm')
```




    Text(0, 0.5, 'WindSpeed3pm')

The above boxplots confirm that there are lot of outliers in these variables.

### Check the distribution of variables


Now, I will plot the histograms to check distributions to find out if they are normal or skewed. If the variable follows normal distribution, then I will do `Extreme Value Analysis` otherwise if they are skewed, I will find IQR (Interquantile range).


```python
# plot histogram to check distribution

plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))


plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
fig = df.Rainfall.hist(bins=10)
fig.set_xlabel('Rainfall')
fig.set_ylabel('RainTomorrow')


plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
fig = df.Evaporation.hist(bins=10)
fig.set_xlabel('Evaporation')
fig.set_ylabel('RainTomorrow')


plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
fig = df.WindSpeed9am.hist(bins=10)
fig.set_xlabel('WindSpeed9am')
fig.set_ylabel('RainTomorrow')


plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
fig = df.WindSpeed3pm.hist(bins=10)
fig.set_xlabel('WindSpeed3pm')
fig.set_ylabel('RainTomorrow')
```




    Text(0, 0.5, 'RainTomorrow')




    
![png](output_103_1.png)
    


We can see that all the four variables are skewed. So, I will use interquantile range to find outliers.


```python
# find outliers for Rainfall variable

IQR = df.Rainfall.quantile(0.75) - df.Rainfall.quantile(0.25)
Lower_fence = df.Rainfall.quantile(0.25) - (IQR * 3)
Upper_fence = df.Rainfall.quantile(0.75) + (IQR * 3)
print('Rainfall outliers are values < {lowerboundary} or > {upperboundary}'.format(lowerboundary=Lower_fence, upperboundary=Upper_fence))

```

    Rainfall outliers are values < -2.4000000000000004 or > 3.2
    

For `Rainfall`, the minimum and maximum values are 0.0 and 371.0. So, the outliers are values > 3.2.


```python
# find outliers for Evaporation variable

IQR = df.Evaporation.quantile(0.75) - df.Evaporation.quantile(0.25)
Lower_fence = df.Evaporation.quantile(0.25) - (IQR * 3)
Upper_fence = df.Evaporation.quantile(0.75) + (IQR * 3)
print('Evaporation outliers are values < {lowerboundary} or > {upperboundary}'.format(lowerboundary=Lower_fence, upperboundary=Upper_fence))

```

    Evaporation outliers are values < -11.800000000000002 or > 21.800000000000004
    

For `Evaporation`, the minimum and maximum values are 0.0 and 145.0. So, the outliers are values > 21.8.


```python
# find outliers for WindSpeed9am variable

IQR = df.WindSpeed9am.quantile(0.75) - df.WindSpeed9am.quantile(0.25)
Lower_fence = df.WindSpeed9am.quantile(0.25) - (IQR * 3)
Upper_fence = df.WindSpeed9am.quantile(0.75) + (IQR * 3)
print('WindSpeed9am outliers are values < {lowerboundary} or > {upperboundary}'.format(lowerboundary=Lower_fence, upperboundary=Upper_fence))

```

    WindSpeed9am outliers are values < -29.0 or > 55.0
    

For `WindSpeed9am`, the minimum and maximum values are 0.0 and 130.0. So, the outliers are values > 55.0.


```python
# find outliers for WindSpeed3pm variable

IQR = df.WindSpeed3pm.quantile(0.75) - df.WindSpeed3pm.quantile(0.25)
Lower_fence = df.WindSpeed3pm.quantile(0.25) - (IQR * 3)
Upper_fence = df.WindSpeed3pm.quantile(0.75) + (IQR * 3)
print('WindSpeed3pm outliers are values < {lowerboundary} or > {upperboundary}'.format(lowerboundary=Lower_fence, upperboundary=Upper_fence))

```

    WindSpeed3pm outliers are values < -20.0 or > 57.0
    

For `WindSpeed3pm`, the minimum and maximum values are 0.0 and 87.0. So, the outliers are values > 57.0.

### Assumption


I assume that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). There are two methods which can be used to impute missing values. One is mean or median imputation and other one is random sample imputation. When there are outliers in the dataset, we should use median imputation. So, I will use median imputation because median imputation is robust to outliers.


I will impute missing values with the appropriate statistical measures of the data, in this case median. Imputation should be done over the training set, and then propagated to the test set. It means that the statistical measures to be used to fill missing values both in train and test set, should be extracted from the train set only. This is to avoid overfitting.


```python
# impute missing values in X_train and X_test with respective column median in X_train

for df1 in [X_train, X_test]:
    for col in numerical:
        col_median=X_train[col].median()
        df1[col].fillna(col_median, inplace=True)           
      
```


```python
# check again missing values in numerical variables in X_train

X_train[numerical].isnull().sum()
```




    MinTemp          0
    MaxTemp          0
    Rainfall         0

Now, we can see that there are no missing values in the numerical columns of training and test set.

As a final check, I will check for missing values in X_train and X_test.

We can see that there are no missing values in X_train and X_test.

### Engineering outliers in numerical variables


We have seen that the `Rainfall`, `Evaporation`, `WindSpeed9am` and `WindSpeed3pm` columns contain outliers. I will use top-coding approach to cap maximum values and remove outliers from the above variables.


```python
def max_value(df3, variable, top):
    return np.where(df3[variable]>top, top, df3[variable])

for df3 in [X_train, X_test]:
    df3['Rainfall'] = max_value(df3, 'Rainfall', 3.2)
    df3['Evaporation'] = max_value(df3, 'Evaporation', 21.8)
    df3['WindSpeed9am'] = max_value(df3, 'WindSpeed9am', 55)
    df3['WindSpeed3pm'] = max_value(df3, 'WindSpeed3pm', 57)
```


```python
X_train.Rainfall.max(), X_test.Rainfall.max()
```




    (3.2, 3.2)




```python
X_train.Evaporation.max(), X_test.Evaporation.max()
```




    (21.8, 21.8)




```python
X_train.WindSpeed9am.max(), X_test.WindSpeed9am.max()
```




    (55.0, 55.0)




```python
X_train.WindSpeed3pm.max(), X_test.WindSpeed3pm.max()
```




    (57.0, 57.0)




```python
X_train[numerical].describe()
```

We can see that two additional variables `RainToday_0` and `RainToday_1` are created from `RainToday` variable.

Now, I will create the `X_train` training set.


```python
X_train = pd.concat([X_train[numerical], X_train[['RainToday_0', 'RainToday_1']],
                     pd.get_dummies(X_train.Location), 
                     pd.get_dummies(X_train.WindGustDir),
                     pd.get_dummies(X_train.WindDir9am),
                     pd.get_dummies(X_train.WindDir3pm)], axis=1)
```

We now have `X_train` dataset ready to be fed into the Logistic Regression classifier. I will do it as follows.

# **12. Model training** <a class="anchor" id="12"></a>


[Table of Contents](#0.1)


```python
# train a logistic regression model on the training set
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression


# instantiate the model
logreg = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', random_state=0)


# fit the model
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

```




    LogisticRegression(C=1.0, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
                       intercept_scaling=1, l1_ratio=None, max_iter=100,
                       multi_class='warn', n_jobs=None, penalty='l2',
                       random_state=0, solver='liblinear', tol=0.0001, verbose=0,
                       warm_start=False)



# **13. Predict results** <a class="anchor" id="13"></a>


[Table of Contents](#0.1)


```python
y_pred_test = logreg.predict(X_test)

y_pred_test
```




    array(['No', 'No', 'No', ..., 'No', 'No', 'Yes'], dtype=object)



### predict_proba method


**predict_proba** method gives the probabilities for the target variable(0 and 1) in this case, in array form.

`0 is for probability of no rain` and `1 is for probability of rain.`


```python
# probability of getting output as 0 - no rain

logreg.predict_proba(X_test)[:,0]
```




    array([0.91382428, 0.83565645, 0.82033915, ..., 0.97674285, 0.79855098,
           0.30734161])




```python
# probability of getting output as 1 - rain

logreg.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
```




    array([0.08617572, 0.16434355, 0.17966085, ..., 0.02325715, 0.20144902,
           0.69265839])



# **14. Check accuracy score** <a class="anchor" id="14"></a>


[Table of Contents](#0.1)


```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

print('Model accuracy score: {0:0.4f}'. format(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_test)))
```

    Model accuracy score: 0.8502
    

Here, **y_test** are the true class labels and **y_pred_test** are the predicted class labels in the test-set.

### Compare the train-set and test-set accuracy


Now, I will compare the train-set and test-set accuracy to check for overfitting.


```python
y_pred_train = logreg.predict(X_train)

y_pred_train
```




    array(['No', 'No', 'No', ..., 'No', 'No', 'No'], dtype=object)




```python
print('Training-set accuracy score: {0:0.4f}'. format(accuracy_score(y_train, y_pred_train)))
```

    Training-set accuracy score: 0.8476
    

### Check for overfitting and underfitting


```python
# print the scores on training and test set

print('Training set score: {:.4f}'.format(logreg.score(X_train, y_train)))

print('Test set score: {:.4f}'.format(logreg.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

    Training set score: 0.8476
    Test set score: 0.8502
    

The training-set accuracy score is 0.8476 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.8501. These two values are quite comparable. So, there is no question of overfitting. 


In Logistic Regression, we use default value of C = 1. It provides good performance with approximately 85% accuracy on both the training and the test set. But the model performance on both the training and test set are very comparable. It is likely the case of underfitting. 

I will increase C and fit a more flexible model.


```python
# fit the Logsitic Regression model with C=100

# instantiate the model
logreg100 = LogisticRegression(C=100, solver='liblinear', random_state=0)


# fit the model
logreg100.fit(X_train, y_train)
```




    LogisticRegression(C=100, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
                       intercept_scaling=1, l1_ratio=None, max_iter=100,
                       multi_class='warn', n_jobs=None, penalty='l2',
                       random_state=0, solver='liblinear', tol=0.0001, verbose=0,
                       warm_start=False)




```python
# print the scores on training and test set

print('Training set score: {:.4f}'.format(logreg100.score(X_train, y_train)))

print('Test set score: {:.4f}'.format(logreg100.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

    Training set score: 0.8478
    Test set score: 0.8505
    

We can see that, C=100 results in higher test set accuracy and also a slightly increased training set accuracy. So, we can conclude that a more complex model should perform better.

Now, I will investigate, what happens if we use more regularized model than the default value of C=1, by setting C=0.01.


```python
# fit the Logsitic Regression model with C=001

# instantiate the model
logreg001 = LogisticRegression(C=0.01, solver='liblinear', random_state=0)


# fit the model
logreg001.fit(X_train, y_train)
```




    LogisticRegression(C=0.01, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
                       intercept_scaling=1, l1_ratio=None, max_iter=100,
                       multi_class='warn', n_jobs=None, penalty='l2',
                       random_state=0, solver='liblinear', tol=0.0001, verbose=0,
                       warm_start=False)




```python
# print the scores on training and test set

print('Training set score: {:.4f}'.format(logreg001.score(X_train, y_train)))

print('Test set score: {:.4f}'.format(logreg001.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

    Training set score: 0.8409
    Test set score: 0.8448
    

So, if we use more regularized model by setting C=0.01, then both the training and test set accuracy decrease relatiev to the default parameters.

### Compare model accuracy with null accuracy


So, the model accuracy is 0.8501. But, we cannot say that our model is very good based on the above accuracy. We must compare it with the **null accuracy**. Null accuracy is the accuracy that could be achieved by always predicting the most frequent class.

So, we should first check the class distribution in the test set. 


```python
# check class distribution in test set

y_test.value_counts()
```




    No     22067
    Yes     6372
    Name: RainTomorrow, dtype: int64



We can see that the occurences of most frequent class is 22067. So, we can calculate null accuracy by dividing 22067 by total number of occurences.


```python
# check null accuracy score

null_accuracy = (22067/(22067+6372))

print('Null accuracy score: {0:0.4f}'. format(null_accuracy))
```

    Null accuracy score: 0.7759
    

We can see that our model accuracy score is 0.8501 but null accuracy score is 0.7759. So, we can conclude that our Logistic Regression model is doing a very good job in predicting the class labels.

Now, based on the above analysis we can conclude that our classification model accuracy is very good. Our model is doing a very good job in terms of predicting the class labels.


But, it does not give the underlying distribution of values. Also, it does not tell anything about the type of errors our classifer is making. 


We have another tool called `Confusion matrix` that comes to our rescue.

# **15. Confusion matrix** <a class="anchor" id="15"></a>


[Table of Contents](#0.1)


A confusion matrix is a tool for summarizing the performance of a classification algorithm. A confusion matrix will give us a clear picture of classification model performance and the types of errors produced by the model. It gives us a summary of correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each category. The summary is represented in a tabular form.


Four types of outcomes are possible while evaluating a classification model performance. These four outcomes are described below:-


**True Positives (TP)** – True Positives occur when we predict an observation belongs to a certain class and the observation actually belongs to that class.


**True Negatives (TN)** – True Negatives occur when we predict an observation does not belong to a certain class and the observation actually does not belong to that class.


**False Positives (FP)** – False Positives occur when we predict an observation belongs to a    certain class but the observation actually does not belong to that class. This type of error is called **Type I error.**



**False Negatives (FN)** – False Negatives occur when we predict an observation does not belong to a certain class but the observation actually belongs to that class. This is a very serious error and it is called **Type II error.**



These four outcomes are summarized in a confusion matrix given below.



```python
# Print the Confusion Matrix and slice it into four pieces

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_test)

print('Confusion matrix\n\n', cm)

print('\nTrue Positives(TP) = ', cm[0,0])

print('\nTrue Negatives(TN) = ', cm[1,1])

print('\nFalse Positives(FP) = ', cm[0,1])

print('\nFalse Negatives(FN) = ', cm[1,0])
```

    Confusion matrix
    
     [[20892  1175]
     [ 3086  3286]]
    
    True Positives(TP) =  20892
    
    True Negatives(TN) =  3286
    
    False Positives(FP) =  1175
    
    False Negatives(FN) =  3086
    

The confusion matrix shows `20892 + 3285 = 24177 correct predictions` and `3087 + 1175 = 4262 incorrect predictions`.


In this case, we have


- `True Positives` (Actual Positive:1 and Predict Positive:1) - 20892


- `True Negatives` (Actual Negative:0 and Predict Negative:0) - 3285


- `False Positives` (Actual Negative:0 but Predict Positive:1) - 1175 `(Type I error)`


- `False Negatives` (Actual Positive:1 but Predict Negative:0) - 3087 `(Type II error)`


```python
# visualize confusion matrix with seaborn heatmap

cm_matrix = pd.DataFrame(data=cm, columns=['Actual Positive:1', 'Actual Negative:0'], 
                                 index=['Predict Positive:1', 'Predict Negative:0'])

sns.heatmap(cm_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='YlGnBu')
```

[Table of Contents](#0.1)

## Classification Report


**Classification report** is another way to evaluate the classification model performance. It displays the  **precision**, **recall**, **f1** and **support** scores for the model. I have described these terms in later.

We can print a classification report as follows:-


```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_test))
```

                  precision    recall  f1-score   support
    
              No       0.87      0.95      0.91     22067
             Yes       0.74      0.52      0.61      6372
    
        accuracy                           0.85     28439
       macro avg       0.80      0.73      0.76     28439
    weighted avg       0.84      0.85      0.84     28439
    
    

## Classification accuracy


```python
TP = cm[0,0]
TN = cm[1,1]
FP = cm[0,1]
FN = cm[1,0]
```


```python
# print classification accuracy

classification_accuracy = (TP + TN) / float(TP + TN + FP + FN)

print('Classification accuracy : {0:0.4f}'.format(classification_accuracy))

```

    Classification accuracy : 0.8502
    

## Classification error


```python
# print classification error

classification_error = (FP + FN) / float(TP + TN + FP + FN)

print('Classification error : {0:0.4f}'.format(classification_error))

```

    Classification error : 0.1498
    

## Precision


**Precision** can be defined as the percentage of correctly predicted positive outcomes out of all the predicted positive outcomes. It can be given as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true and false positives (TP + FP). 


So, **Precision** identifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive outcome. It is more concerned with the positive class than the negative class.



Mathematically, precision can be defined as the ratio of `TP to (TP + FP).`





```python
# print precision score

precision = TP / float(TP + FP)


print('Precision : {0:0.4f}'.format(precision))

```

    Precision : 0.9468
    

## Recall


Recall can be defined as the percentage of correctly predicted positive outcomes out of all the actual positive outcomes.
It can be given as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (TP + FN). **Recall** is also called **Sensitivity**.


**Recall** identifies the proportion of correctly predicted actual positives.


Mathematically, recall can be given as the ratio of `TP to (TP + FN).`






```python
recall = TP / float(TP + FN)

print('Recall or Sensitivity : {0:0.4f}'.format(recall))
```

    Recall or Sensitivity : 0.8713
    

## True Positive Rate


**True Positive Rate** is synonymous with **Recall**.



```python
true_positive_rate = TP / float(TP + FN)


print('True Positive Rate : {0:0.4f}'.format(true_positive_rate))
```

    True Positive Rate : 0.8713
    

## False Positive Rate


```python
false_positive_rate = FP / float(FP + TN)


print('False Positive Rate : {0:0.4f}'.format(false_positive_rate))
```

    False Positive Rate : 0.2634
    

## Specificity


```python
specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

print('Specificity : {0:0.4f}'.format(specificity))
```

    Specificity : 0.7366
    

## f1-score


**f1-score** is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. The best possible **f1-score** would be 1.0 and the worst 
would be 0.0.  **f1-score** is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. So, **f1-score** is always lower than accuracy measures as they embed precision and recall into their computation. The weighted average of `f1-score` should be used to 
compare classifier models, not global accuracy.



## Support


**Support** is the actual number of occurrences of the class in our dataset.

# **17. Adjusting the threshold level** <a class="anchor" id="17"></a>

```python
# print the first 10 predicted probabilities of two classes- 0 and 1

y_pred_prob = logreg.predict_proba(X_test)[0:10]

y_pred_prob
```




    array([[0.91382428, 0.08617572],

           [0.85485267, 0.14514733]])



### Observations


- In each row, the numbers sum to 1.


- There are 2 columns which correspond to 2 classes - 0 and 1.

    - Class 0 - predicted probability that there is no rain tomorrow.    
    
    - Class 1 - predicted probability that there is rain tomorrow.
        
    
- Importance of predicted probabilities

    - We can rank the observations by probability of rain or no rain.


- predict_proba process

    - Predicts the probabilities    
    
    - Choose the class with the highest probability    
    
    
- Classification threshold level

    - There is a classification threshold level of 0.5.    
    
    - Class 1 - probability of rain is predicted if probability > 0.5.    
    
    - Class 0 - probability of no rain is predicted if probability < 0.5.    
    



```python
# store the probabilities in dataframe

y_pred_prob_df = pd.DataFrame(data=y_pred_prob, columns=['Prob of - No rain tomorrow (0)', 'Prob of - Rain tomorrow (1)'])

### Observations


- We can see that the above histogram is highly positive skewed.


- The first column tell us that there are approximately 15000 observations with probability between 0.0 and 0.1.


- There are small number of observations with probability > 0.5.


- So, these small number of observations predict that there will be rain tomorrow.


- Majority of observations predict that there will be no rain tomorrow.

### Comments


- In binary problems, the threshold of 0.5 is used by default to convert predicted probabilities into class predictions.


- Threshold can be adjusted to increase sensitivity or specificity. 


- Sensitivity and specificity have an inverse relationship. Increasing one would always decrease the other and vice versa.


- We can see that increasing the threshold level results in increased accuracy.


- Adjusting the threshold level should be one of the last step you do in the model-building process.

## ROC Curve


Another tool to measure the classification model performance visually is **ROC Curve**. ROC Curve stands for **Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve**. An **ROC Curve** is a plot which shows the performance of a classification model at various 
classification threshold levels. 



The **ROC Curve** plots the **True Positive Rate (TPR)** against the **False Positive Rate (FPR)** at various threshold levels.



**True Positive Rate (TPR)** is also called **Recall**. It is defined as the ratio of `TP to (TP + FN).`



**False Positive Rate (FPR)** is defined as the ratio of `FP to (FP + TN).`




In the ROC Curve, we will focus on the TPR (True Positive Rate) and FPR (False Positive Rate) of a single point. This will give us the general performance of the ROC curve which consists of the TPR and FPR at various threshold levels. So, an ROC Curve plots TPR vs FPR at different classification threshold levels. If we lower the threshold levels, it may result in more items being classified as positve. It will increase both True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP).




```python
# plot ROC Curve

from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve

fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred1, pos_label = 'Yes')

plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))

plt.plot(fpr, tpr, linewidth=2)

plt.plot([0,1], [0,1], 'k--' )

plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 12

plt.title('ROC curve for RainTomorrow classifier')

plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity)')

plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)')

plt.show()

```


    
![png](output_235_0.png)
    


ROC curve help us to choose a threshold level that balances sensitivity and specificity for a particular context.

## ROC-AUC


**ROC AUC** stands for **Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve**. It is a technique to compare classifier performance. In this technique, we measure the `area under the curve (AUC)`. A perfect classifier will have a ROC AUC equal to 1, whereas a purely random classifier will have a ROC AUC equal to 0.5. 


So, **ROC AUC** is the percentage of the ROC plot that is underneath the curve.


```python
# compute ROC AUC

from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

ROC_AUC = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred1)

print('ROC AUC : {:.4f}'.format(ROC_AUC))
```

    ROC AUC : 0.8729
    

### Comments


- ROC AUC is a single number summary of classifier performance. The higher the value, the better the classifier.

- ROC AUC of our model approaches towards 1. So, we can conclude that our classifier does a good job in predicting whether it will rain tomorrow or not.


```python
# calculate cross-validated ROC AUC 

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

Cross_validated_ROC_AUC = cross_val_score(logreg, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='roc_auc').mean()

print('Cross validated ROC AUC : {:.4f}'.format(Cross_validated_ROC_AUC))
```

    Cross validated ROC AUC : 0.8695

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

scores = cross_val_score(logreg, X_train, y_train, cv = 5, scoring='accuracy')

print('Cross-validation scores:{}'.format(scores))
```

    Cross-validation scores:[0.84686387 0.84624852 0.84633642 0.84963298 0.84773626]
    

We can summarize the cross-validation accuracy by calculating its mean.


```python
# compute Average cross-validation score

print('Average cross-validation score: {:.4f}'.format(scores.mean()))
```

    Average cross-validation score: 0.8474
    

Our, original model score is found to be 0.8476. The average cross-validation score is 0.8474. So, we can conclude that cross-validation does not result in performance improvement.
